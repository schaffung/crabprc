Shinning objects always attract, I guess for me the equivalent would
be some new framework or language to try just to see what it offers. There's
an inherent joy in writing a code, writing the same set of logic which you've
already accomplished in some other language, and then building the code and
seeing it run.

This repository is just a public record of me trying out Rust. Is there any
reason behind selecting this language ? Well..to be honest, I have been hearing
a lot of noise ( and information ) about it being the next language in league
with C and C++.

Now I've had worked with C and C++, so it is natuaral to pick a language which
is being praised and is predicted to eat up some code in the linux kernel
itself in future. It might or might not happen as many a time decisions are not
taken based on just the performance and technical factors. One also needs to
see if there are enough people ready to contribute code in said language and
also keep on maintaining it.

Without further ado, this is just me playing with rust and pushing some code
for my reference.
